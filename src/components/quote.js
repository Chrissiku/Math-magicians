        The mechanical loom and the calculator have shown us that technology is
        both disruptive and filled with opportunities. But it would be hard to
        find a decent argument that we would have been better off without these
        inventions. Oren Etzioni

        People think that the arts are optional and they are not. They teach a
        level of emotional depth that is equally important to mathematic skill.
        You can replace some math skills with a calculator if you know how to
        operate the thing, but there is no calculator for human interaction. Hal

        My colleagues and I were engineers who worked for DCM&#39;s calculator
        division. These electronic calculators used digital integrated circuits,
        and then they started using chips. The advanced versions of those chips
        were used for programmable calculators, which were the forerunners of
        PCs. Shiv Nadar
